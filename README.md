Automated Workflow for Processing Purchase Orders from PDFs via Google Drive

This n8n workflow monitors a specific Google Drive folder for new PDF files (Purchase Orders). 
It automatically extracts relevant information, structures the data into variables, and uses a custom code node to classify whether the data belongs to individual customers or companies. The cleaned and categorized data is then saved into a Google Sheet, which is stored in another Google Drive folder. This structured dataset can be used later for sending promotional campaigns or automated notifications.
